# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Network

**AIM:** To create a simulation of an efficient communication network using packet tracer.

# **Solution:**

**COMPONENTS USED:**

- 22 nodes (PCs (type "PC-PT"))
- 4 routers (type "Router-PT")
- 8 switches (type "Switch-PT") 

**DESCRIPTION:**

- This is a simulation to configure the network for the Research &amp; Development and Technical department.
- Herein Research &amp; Development Department has 4 R&amp;D Labs and Technical Department has 4 offices.
- Communication is on inter as well as intra level i.e. communication can not only occur within the department but also between the departments.
- This enables an efficient means of communication between the Computer and the IT department using Ring Topology.
